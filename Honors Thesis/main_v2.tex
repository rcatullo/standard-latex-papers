\section{Definitions}
In this section we fix standard definitions and notations for objects used throughout this paper, largely following the notes in \cite{zhu}. Let $F$ be a local field over $k$ with ring of integers $\calo$. Upon choice of uniformizer $t \in \calo$ we have $F \cong k((t))$ and $\calo \cong k[[t]]$. Let $D = \spec k[[t]]$ denote the disk, and $D^* = \spec k((t))$ the punctured disk. For a $k$-algebra $R$, we let $D_R = D \hat{\times} \spec R = \spec R[[t]]$ and similarly $D^*_R = D^* \hat{\times} \spec R = \spec R((t))$.

Let $G$ be an affine group scheme smooth over $k[[t]]$. 
\begin{defn}
    The \textit{affine Grassmannian} of $G$ is
