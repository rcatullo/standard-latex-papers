# Mathematics LaTeX Templates and Papers

## Skeleton

The skeleton folder contains a basic outline for a mathematics paper written in LaTeX. The *main.txt* file contains a basic paper outline. The *standard.sty* file contains standard mathmode shorthands for common objects as well as formatting of titles, sections, subsections, tocs, and bibliographys. The *refs.bib* file should contain bibliography references.

## Beamer Skeleton
The skeleton-beamer folder contains an outline for beamer presentations. The *main.txt* file contains a basic presentation outline. The theme and colortheme are contained in *standard-beamer.sty*, as well as nonconflicting packages and mathmode shorthands from standard.sty. The logo is contained in *Images/block_logo.png* and can be changed from within standard-beamer.sty.

## Papers

This contains the TeX files for my publically available mathematics research papers and lecture notes. I cannot guarantee correctness of any material contained
in these papers but you are welcome to contact me if there is a glaring issue that needs attention.
